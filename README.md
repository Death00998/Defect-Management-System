Introduction

Project Background 

By using traditional ways to submit defect problems, a defect management system could provide end users and the admin faster, easier ways to solve the defect problems. One construction site will have over 100 units, since every unit having defect problems will cause the construction company to spend over budget to fix those defects.

End User complains about the defect by writing down and pasting the sticky notes at the defect place, there is a chance that the company will reject their defect. Sometimes companies canâ€™t do it at times as they have to track up to 1000-unit defects.

In response to this problem, this project's purpose is to investigate more systematic programs that reduce time and cost for both end user and company. The plan of this project is to carry out an all-inclusive participatory investigation into options for defect of new vacant possession, monitor the task, and update the newest information to the end user.

Aim & Objective

The aim of this project is to make more efficient and quality construction and building. A construction site using a Defect Management System (as known as DMS) can improve construction site efficiency as hundreds or thousands of defects from an apartment or condo; While the end user could report and track the defect progression. Different by traditional way to defect, by using a system can reduce human error and complete the defect on time.

The objective of this project is:

To generate the defect of new vacant possession by user
To manage the task progressing by management
To track progression of defect by manager and user
